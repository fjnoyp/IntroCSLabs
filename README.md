# IntroCSLabs
Select labs from my first class in computer science.  Files with "class" in front of their folder indicate labs done for class, otherwise, these files are 5-10 hours side projects I undertook to learn more about a certain CS concept that I was interested in.  The most notable project is "GrowingTree" which simulated tree growths.
